## API Choice and Rationale
Google Vision API
## Why Google Vision API?
Accurate OCR capabilities for extracting text from images.
Easy integration with Node.js through the @google-cloud/vision library.
High reliability and performance for parsing various receipt formats.
Limitations:
Requires a Google Cloud account and billing setup.
Sensitive to image qualityâ€”blurry or low-resolution images may yield inaccurate results.

## Limitations and Assumptions
Image Quality: Parsing accuracy depends on the clarity of the receipt image.
Format Dependence: The app is optimized for standard receipt layouts. Non-standard layouts may not be processed accurately.
Vendor Name Extraction: Assumes vendor names are at the top of the receipt in uppercase.
Manual API Key Input: In production, users must input their API key for secure and personalized usage.

## Notable Features
JSON Output:
Parsed receipt details are saved as a JSON file (parsed_receipt.json) for external usage.
Server-Side OCR Parsing:
Offloads processing to a server for efficient handling of large image files.
Frontend Integration:
Includes a simple UI for users to upload receipt images and view extracted details.
